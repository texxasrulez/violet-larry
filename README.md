# Colorful Roundcube Skins based off Larry

## Compatible with Roundcube 1.6	

**Major Changes since 07/06/2020**

Completely redesigned Tabs.
More detailed images.
CSS Fixes and code cleanup.

**Composer Install**
```
composer require "texxasrulez/violet-larry"
```

**Compatible with RC Version: 1.4.x and beyond**

I have taken the Larry skin and modified it so there are 10 themes to choose from so far. Larry Skin has the best layout of all other themes in my opinion, so why reinvent the wheel when all I want is a wider color choice.

I have also included skins for many popular plugins and the ones I use. If you need help with a plugin skin not available with this, please message me and ask. I just might can help you out ... 

**Skins for Plugins included:**

The Larry Skin from Roundcube 1.3 was used, so you must be running RC 1.3 or higher.

Keep coming back often as I have plans on at least 18 total skins.

Installation is easy. Upload plugins and skins folders to your Roundcube installation root and it should copy to all appropriate file locations ... 

Note: Current Commit should be a working version of my ongoing nitpicking of some small color changes and making transparent images when necessary. Download and use with confidence.

Latest Update makes skins compatible with Roundcube 1.4 ...

If you use these Skins and would like to show your appreciation by buying me a cup of coffee, I surely would appreciate it. It took me almost 6 months to create these and evidently the time from then till now (end date not in sight) to refine it. It is all good. I love it and do it to repay the OSS Community, but it would make the world of difference if just a few user wanted to buy me a coffee. A regular cup of Joe is great, but a Starbucks Coffee would be better ... \

No Zelle in your banks mobile app, no problem, just click [Paypal](https://paypal.me/texxasrulez?locale.x=en_US) and I can make a Starbucks run ...
